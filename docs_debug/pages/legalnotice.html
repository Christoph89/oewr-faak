      <h2>Data Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Our website may be used without entering personal information. 
        Different rules may apply to certain services on our site, however, 
        and are explained separately below. We collect personal information from you 
        (e.g. name, address, email address, telephone number, etc.) 
        in accordance with the provisions of Austrian data protection statutes. 
        Information is considered personal if it can be associated exclusively 
        to a specific natural person. 
        <br /><br />
        Please also be aware that data transfer via the internet is subject to security risks and, 
        therefore, complete protection against third-party 
        access to transferred data cannot be ensured.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        Our website makes use of so-called cookies in order to recognize repeat
        use of our website by the same user/internet connection subscriber.
        Cookies are small text files that your internet browser downloads and 
        stores on your computer. They are used to improve our website and services. 
        In most cases these are so-called "session cookies" that are deleted once 
        you leave our website.
        <br /><br />
        To an extent, however, these cookies also pass along information used
        to automatically recognize you. Recognition occurs through an
        IP address saved to the cookies. The information thereby obtained
        is used to improve our services and to expedite your access to the website.
        <br /><br />
        You can prevent cookies from being installed by adjusting the settings
        on your browser software accordingly. You should be aware, however,
        that by doing so you may not be able to make full use of all the functions of our website
      </p>
      
      <h3>Server Data</h3>
      <p>
        For technical reasons, data such as the following, which your internet browser
        transmits to us or to our web space provider (so called server log files),
        is collected: - type and version of the browser you use - operating system
        - websites that linked you to our site (referrer URL) - websites that you visit
        - date and time of your visit - your Internet Protocol (IP) address.
        This anonymous data is stored separately from any personal information
        you may have provided, thereby making it impossible to connect it
        to any particular person. The data is used for statistical purposes
        in order to improve our website and services.
      </p>


      <h3>Contacting us</h3>
      <p>
        On our website we offer you the opportunity to contact us, 
        either by email and/or by using a contact form. In such event, 
        information provided by the user is stored for the 
        purpose of facilitating communications with the user.
        No data is transferred to third parties. Nor is any of this
        information matched to any information that may be collected
        by other components of our website.
      </p>

      <h3>Purpose of Registering</h3>
      <p>
        We offer you the opportunity to register for specific courses/trainings/tours/camps. 
        The information entered when registering, as shown in the registration form
        is collected and stored solely for use by our website/offer. 
        None of this information is transferred to third parties.
      </p>

      <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
      <p>
        Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service
        from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA,
        hereinafter referred to as “Google“. Google Analytics employs so-called
        “cookies“, text files that are stored to your computer in order
        to facilitate an analysis of your use of the site.
        <br /><br />
        The information generated by these cookies, such as time,
        place and frequency of your visits to our site, 
        including your IP address, is transmitted to Google’s
        location in the US and stored there.
        <br /><br />
        We use Google Analytics with an IP anonymization feature on our website.
        In doing so, Google abbreviates and thereby anonymizes your
        IP address before transferring it from member states of
        the European Union or signatory states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
        <br /><br />
        Google will use this information to evaluate your usage of our site,
        to compile reports on website activity for us, and to provide other services
        related to website- and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information
        to third parties if this is required by law or to the extent this
        data is processed by third parties on Google´s behalf.
        <br /><br />
        Google states that it will in never associate your IP address with
        other data held by Google. You can prevent cookies from being installed
        by adjusting the settings on your browser software accordingly.
        You should be aware, however, that by doing so you may not be able
        to make full use of all the functions of our website.
        <br /><br />
        Google also offers a disabling option for the most common browsers,
        thus providing you with greater control over the data which is collected
        and processed by Google. If you enable this option, no information regarding
        your website visit is transmitted to Google Analytics. However, the activation
        does not prevent the transmission of information to us or to any other
        web analytics services we may use. For more information about the disabling
        option provided by Google, and how to enable this option,
        visit <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>
      </p>

      <h3>Google Maps</h3>
      <p>
        We use the “Google Maps” component of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway,
        Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, hereinafter “Google.”
        <br /><br />
        Google sets a cookie in order to process the user configuration and
        data when the page with the integrated “Google Maps” component is displayed.
        As a general rule, this cookie is not deleted by closing the browser,
        but rather expires after a certain time, as long as it is not previously
        manually deleted by you.
        <br /><br />
        If you do not agree with this processing of your data, you may choose
        to deactivate the “Google Maps” service and thereby prevent the transfer
        of data to Google. To do this, you must deactivate the Java Script function
        in your browser. However, we would like to point out that in this case
        you will not be able to use “Google Maps” or at least only to a limited extent.
        <br /><br />
        The use of “Google Maps” and the information obtained through “Google Maps”
        is according to Google’s Terms of Use 
        <br /><br />
        <a href="http://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/terms/regional.html">http://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/terms/regional.html</a>
        <br /><br />
        as well as the additional Terms and Conditions for "Google Maps"

      </p>

      <h3>Use of reCAPTCHA</h3>
      <p>
        In order to protect input forms on our site, we use the “reCAPTCHA” service
        of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA,
        hereinafter "Google." By means of this service it can be distinguished
        whether the corresponding input is of human origin or is created improperly
        by automated machine processing.
        <br /><br />
        To our knowledge, the referrer URL, the IP address, the behaviour of
        the website visitors, information about the operating system,
        browser and length of stay, cookies, display instructions and scripts,
        user input behaviour and mouse movements in the “reCAPTCHA” checkbox
        are conveyed to “Google.”
        <br /><br />
        Google uses the information obtained, among other things, to digitize books
        and other printed matter as well as to optimize services such as
        Google Street View and Google Maps (e.g. house number and street name recognition).
        <br /><br />
        The IP address provided as part of “reCAPTCHA” is not merged with other
        data from Google unless you are logged into your Google Account at
        the time the "reCAPTCHA" plug-in is used. If you want to prevent this
        transmission and storage of data by “Google” about you and your behaviour
        on our website, you must log out of “Google” before you visit our site or
        before using the reCAPTCHA plug-in.
        <br /><br />
        The use of the “reCAPTCHA” service is according to the Google Terms of Use: 
        <br /><br />

      <h3>Information/Cancellation/Deletion</h3>
      <p>
        On the basis of the Federal Data Protection Act, you may contact
        us at no cost if you have questions relating to the collection,
        processing or use of your personal information, if you wish to request
        the correction, blocking or deletion of the same, or if you wish
        to cancel explicitly granted consent. Please note that you have
        the right to have incorrect data corrected or to have personal data deleted,
        where such claim is not barred by any legal obligation to retain this data.
